Although wealthier countries might be able to initially face the threat better due to sophisticated technologies, ultimately all countries will be massively affected by the problem. Less wealthy countries such as Bangladesh, Maldives, and Indonesia are already witnessing serious problems due to climate change. But collectively, we are not concerned enough with the severity of the issue. This talk will discuss how to think about climate change as a national security issue, to create more urgency in addressing this problem</p>

		     <p><!-- put blurb here -->Slow, messy, fluid inquiry asks us to sit in the discomfort of the unknown and allows for alternative ways of thinking by encouraging variability and instability. Inquiry that takes place in and describes the (un)predictable precarity of living and dying in the Anthropocene must embrace these unknowns. The challenge I accept in this presentation is to engage with the mess to see what it reveals about education in a more-than-human world. This multispecies ethnography emerges from the entangled stories of children and all that matter(s) in education on coffee plantations in Southeastern Brazil and illustrates that post-anthropocentric education has no boundary between the formal and non-formal.</p>

		     <p>We are PhD students at ASU who are feminists and Latinas. We recognize that facing the academy could be a challenge that hits the intersections that each of us carry.  We have organized into a Feminist Collective (La Corilla) to talk about these intersections, environmental justice, feminist theories and how these can be integrated to change the dynamics in academia. We seek to support each other through this process, empower others who are in similar positions, and write our stories beyond academic papers. Our presentation will also discuss why it is important for students to be activists as well as scholars using our own lived experiences.</p>

		     <p>Activist students have a responsibility to use their knowledge to create a more environmentally and socially just world. To this purpose, we will be presenting about how our origins and formation as student activists led us to study rural Puerto Rican communities that produce the drinking water they consume without depending on state agencies or private companies. We began our activist work in Puerto Rico defending access to the public university and, in the process, came to understand the socio-environmental struggles that are taking place around the Puerto Rico Archipelago. We are now focusing our work on creating an organization that will lead to the generation of community decolonization.</p>

Under thedirection of Vanessa Ramirez, the group began as a recreational class at the City of Chandler’s Snedigar Recreation Center. As one of very few East Valley folklorico groups currently operating, interest in the dance troupe has grown rapidly from just 6 students in June of 2008 to more than 90 students currently. Ballet Folklorico Quetzalli-AZ’s students range in age from 5 to adult and enjoy an exciting and fun way to express themselves through dance and learn about Hispanic heritage.  Each child shares in class what they’ve learned in a presentation. This encourages self-esteem through cultivating public speaking skills as well as the showmanship of performance. It has been wonderful to observe the growth and confidence that these young children have developed in such a short time. They are truly an inspiration.</p>

		     <p>Join us for a panel of speakers who work on challenging injustices on the border.  While treatment of immigrants dominates the headlines, there are environmental and technological injustice that are less-well known but deeply impactful for border communities, and human and non-human alike.  This panel will discuss the status of wall construction in Arizona right now, the reckless use of groundwater, environmental destruction in relation to climate change and how making the desert deadlier only serves border security interests, the prosecution of humanitarian aid workers vs. total legal impunity for DHS to break all laws.  The ways that technologies are increasingly used to track, surveil and identify border communities and migrants also present new kinds of violence on the border. The panel will also discuss community resistance to wall construction across the borderlands, and ways that you can help.</p>
