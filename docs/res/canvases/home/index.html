<p>
We welcome you to the 18th Annual Local to Global
Justice Forum and Festival - a weekend of workshops, panels, children’s activities and keynote speakers – and a community solidarity action focused on asylum seekers. Workshops and panels will address issues of justice, including immigration, the criminal system, economic and education justice and indigenous rights, —all while enjoying healthy food, spoken word performances, live music, youth activities, and holistic health opportunities. Please spend some time visiting the tables in the breezeway and feel free to share information on your own groups and upcoming events on the table across from the snack and beverage area.

This year’s theme, <b>Radical Imaginations</b>, asks participants at the 2019 Local to Global Justice Forum & Festival to re-imagine our communities as radically different from our present political, environmental, and economic context. When we use the word “radical,” we mean embodied activism that envisions a complete change in the status quo challenging systemic and structural injustices in relation to power dynamics and traditional (and divisive) political identities. Imagining these changes is a critical step in creating alternative political identities and goals that will make our world a more equitable and inclusive place. We envision Local to Global Justice as a space for community activists to gather freely and exchange these radical imaginations of different futures where structural injustices have been recognized and addressed.
